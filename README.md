# nextjs15-learning-template
This is a template with start code for the basic pages you may need if you want to learn how to build a fully functional full-stack nextjs or separate stack app with nextjs. It includes grouped routes which are: public pages, account, dashboard and authentication pages all with distinct layouts.

In this template I just intended using MongoDB for simplicy, but you can simply use any database of your choice.

## The Installed packages
Some of the packages I installed include: shadcn-ui with all it's components and @hookform/resolver.

These should be enough to start exploring any other technologies.
